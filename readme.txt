Endangered Species Portfolio Project: Biodiversity in National Parks

i am a student taking classes through codecademy. as part of the business intelligence data analytics coursework i have been
assigned two related sets of data to explore, clean, and analyze. the assignment from codecademy reads:

    For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

    You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns
    or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as
    well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

    After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.

there was no readme included with the two provided datasets.
